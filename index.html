          <p> <b> Data Collection:</b>In class we talked a lot about ethical processes in which we collect data. For the dear data project, we were asked to collect data on ourselves in an ethical manner to describe how media has affected our lives. We were required to think about tracking something media related for a week and then by the end of the week be able to make insights into how media may affect us in ways that we were previously unaware of. </p>
          <p> I spent a week collecting data about where I use my phone the most and which apps that I used the most in those locations. The assignment was to think about something that you could track your interaction with media and how that can affect your everyday life. In order to track my data, I created a sheet that I could fill out, so I didn’t have to open my laptop every time I needed to say when I used my phone. The categories that I created to track my data was the time I used my phone, which apps I was using, the reason for picking up my phone, the location, the duration I used my phone for, if I used more apps that what I intended and if I did which app, then I tracked the urgency in which I felt to check my phone. </p>
          <p> Once I finished collecting the data at the end of the week, I had to determine which data points I felt would be the most interesting to include in a chart. I decided that the location and the apps would be the most insightful data points to represent my interaction with media. I found from the data that I use my home most when I am at home and that I use the texting app the most, which wasn’t surprising to me. However, I did find that I used my phone a lot during class too and I found that is probably where I see the biggest impact on my life with media and I needed to find a way to represent this in the correct layout.
</p>
<p> <b> Data Visualization:</b>In class we read an article about different layouts that would represent different relationships. We drafted several different layouts that we felt would work for the data we wanted to represent. I personally struggled a lot with choosing the correct layout because I was overwhelmed with the amount of data that I had collected. </p>
<p> For the visualization I chose to use the matrix chart, but this wasn’t my first attempt. I had attempted to create a different chart, but the chart didn’t represent the data in a way that was relevant. So, I ended up with the chart on the left. For the chart I wanted to represent the apps that I used in certain locations. Within the chart you can also see how often I used the app in certain locations. From the chart I learned that I use my phone most at home, which wasn’t a huge surprise since I spend the most time there. I also found that I use the iPhone messaging app the most on my phone. Another insight that I gained was that I use my phone a decent amount during class, mostly for texting. So, it seems that my impact by media would probably be the constant distraction that it brings. </p>

            <p> <b> Explained Video: </b>  We first learned about the explained genre in class and basically, they are used to simplify a complicated topic and explain it in a short video. For our assignment we were assigned to choose a topic provided and come up with a video to explain that topic. This project was a group project, so I was working with two other people to make this video. </p>
            <p>Our video topic was psychographics and we put together a video to explain what psychographics is, how psychographics affects every day life, and what the ethics of using psychographics are. The first thing that we did after picking the topic was to research about it because none of us had really ever hear of psychographics. After I began researching, I learned that it is data that is collected on the internet about people and places them into groups. Those groups consist of common personality traits and interests. We found that this data is commonly used for ad targeting. For example, if you visit a website with recipes, you might get ads about other recipe websites in other places. With the research we also discovered some ethical dilemmas of psychographics. Psychographics has found ways in which to discriminate against certain races because of their interests. Certain races have common interests and that causes them to be put in the same group effectively being set up to be discriminated against. </p>

                  <p><b> Conclusion: </b> Overall, I learned that media is all around me and can easily affect everything that I do. I found the projects very helpful to helping me gain these insights about media. I was also able to learn about psychographics. I now know that psychographics is something that I most likely can’t avoid and should know that I have likely been put into a group to get certain advertisements based on my previous media interactions. This is my datastory. </p>
